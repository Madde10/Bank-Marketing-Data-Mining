# Bank-Marketing-Data-Mining
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required, to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The data covers the period from May 2008 to November 2010.
